# Python-I-Final-Project
Final Project

* Commit and upload your final project using Github like previous homeworks. 
* Add instructions in this README.md file to demonstrate your project.
* We will demonstrate our projects on June 12, 2019. If you can't attend, I will try to run your program for the class.
* If the program does not run, I will have to deduct major points, so please make sure it runs!
* If I can't get it to run, I may reach out and ask you to fix your program. 

Instructions:
1. Run code
2. It will ask you to 'Enter Ingredients'
3. Enter the ingredients (the more you enter the better the results)
3a. Must enter multiple word ingredient names with an underscore (i.e. red_bell_pepper)
3b. Each ingredient must be a singular (instead of pickles type pickle, fennel_seeds type fennel_seed, etc) 
3c. The ingredients should be separated by a blank space. 
4. Once all the ingredients are added, run the code. 
5. If you have a complete match it will output the title of the Recipe which you can then search for. If no recipe matched it will print 'You do not have enough ingredients'
